/* README for include: global headers for standalone system */
/* that is, headers used in multiple source directories */
/* all but sysapi and sasys are derived from Linux */

/* for tiny C library (from Linux and Xinu) and dev-indep I/O */
stdio.h: for printf, etc., plus putc/getc, etc. with devs
ctype.h: usual ctype, for lib ctype macros
sysapi.h: included from stdio.h, dev-indep i/o, other sys calls

/* for portability between ELF and a.out build environments */
linkage.h: macroes for ELF/a.out portable gnu assembly language

/* for hardware functionality */
io.h: macros for i/o ports

/* for kernel-boot and kernel-tutor interfacing and basic build constants */
params.h: build constants and locations of boot info, sysapi struct

/* the following are used only in the kernel, not tutor, sources */
system.h: macros for CPU actions, uses kernel IDT location
sasys.h: prototypes for kernel-private functions
